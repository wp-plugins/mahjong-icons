== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that replaces mahjong tile expressions in your posts or comments to the mahjong tile icon images. 

Supported expressions are following:

* [1p], [2p], ...[9p] : 1-9 dots (pin-zu)
* [1s], [2s], ...[9s] : 1-9 bamboos (so-zu)
* [1m], [2m], ...[9m] : 1-9 characters (man-zu)
* [5pr], [5sr], [5mr] : red 5's (aka-wo)
* [ton]               : East  (ton)
* [nan]               : South (nan)
* [sha]               : West  (sha)
* [pei]               : North (pei)
* [hak]               : White (haku)
* [hat]               : Green (hatsu)
* [chu]               : Red   (chun)
* [ura]               : Backside (ura)

Adding 'l'(landscape) after each expression shows the 90-degree-rotated image. For example, [1pl] shows rotated [1p] image. 

You can escape the expression by adding another braces like [[1p]]. 

All icons are from the website http://www4.cty-net.ne.jp/~l6000all/haigapage.htm and those are the copyright-free.
